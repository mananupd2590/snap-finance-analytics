# Task 1 – Application Funnel Analysis at Snap Finance

## Objective
The goal was to analyze the lifecycle of customer applications — from applying, to getting approved, to actually using the financing product. This flow represents a typical **application funnel**, and our job was to uncover how well it's performing.

## Why These Visualizations Were Chosen
Instead of showing too many charts and confusing stakeholders, I focused on **two simple but powerful visualizations**:

1. A **conversion funnel bar chart**
2. A **time-based line chart** showing weekly and monthly performance

These two views help answer the most important questions:
- “**How well are we converting users at each stage?**”
- “**How do our applications trend over time?**”

## Visualization 1: Application Funnel Bar Chart

This chart compares:
- **Total Applications** — customers who applied
- **Approved Applications** — those who got approved
- **Used Applications** — customers who actually used the financing

### Key Insights:
- There is a clear **funnel drop-off** between each stage.
- Around **50% of applicants get approved**, which shows decent underwriting efficiency.
- However, **only a small portion of approved customers actually use the product**, indicating a potential **leak in the funnel**.
- This gap suggests the need to explore **why customers are not completing the financing process** — is it due to UX friction, unclear instructions, or lack of need?

## Visualization 2: Weekly & Monthly Trend Charts

These line charts show how applications behave **over time** — one by **week** and one by **month**.

### Key Insights:
- **Weekly Trend** shows short-term fluctuations, indicating possible reaction to campaigns or pay cycles.
- **Monthly Trend** smooths this data and shows a consistent flow of applications.
- Both trends confirm that while **applications and approvals stay steady**, **usage remains much lower** in every time period.
- This consistency across time confirms that the funnel issue is **systemic** — not caused by any one-time event.

## Final Thoughts

These charts were kept intentionally simple — clean, clear, and useful for both technical and non-technical teams. They directly reflect:
- **Conversion efficiency**
- **Time-based behavior of users**
- **Where we might lose customers**

The next step would be to drill deeper into **why usage drops** and explore **funnel optimizations**.
