# Task 1 – Application Funnel Analysis at Snap Finance

## Objective
The goal was to analyze the lifecycle of customer applications — from applying, to getting approved, to actually using the financing product. This flow represents a typical **application funnel**, and our job was to uncover how well it's performing.

## Why These Visualizations Were Chosen
Instead of showing too many charts and confusing stakeholders, I focused on **two simple but powerful visualizations**:

1. A **time-based line chart** showing weekly and monthly performance
2. A **conversion funnel bar chart**

These two views help answer the most important questions:
- “**How do our applications trend over time?**”
- “**How well are we converting users at each stage?**”

## Visualization 1: Application Funnel Bar Chart

This chart compares:
- **Total Applications** — customers who applied
- **Approved Applications** — those who got approved
- **Used Applications** — customers who actually used the financing

### Key Insights:
- There is a clear **funnel drop-off** between each stage.
- Around **50% of applicants get approved**, which shows decent underwriting efficiency considering that the company is aware of its risk-rewward ratio.
- However, **only a small portion of approved customers actually use the product**.
- This gap suggests the need to explore **why customers are not completing the financing process** — is it due to UX friction, unclear instructions, or lack of need? (Well that deserves another meeting with the stakeholders to discuss the possibility and analyze further)

## Visualization 2: Weekly & Monthly Trend Charts

These line charts show how applications behave **over time** — one by **week** and one by **month**.

### Key Insights:
- **Weekly Trend** shows short-term fluctuations, indicating possible reaction to campaigns or pay cycles.
- **Monthly Trend** smooths this data and shows a consistent flow of applications.
- Both trends confirm that while **applications and approvals stay steady**, **usage remains much lower** in every time period.
- This consistency across time confirms that the funnel issue is **systemic** not caused by any one-time event.
- But this is just stagnant growth. If we need to grow further we need to amp up and analzye where we are lacking behind and be at the top of our game.

## Final Thoughts

These charts were kept intentionally simple clean, clear, and useful for both technical and non-technical teams. They directly reflect:
- **Conversion efficiency**
- **Time-based behavior of users**
- **Where we might lose customers**
