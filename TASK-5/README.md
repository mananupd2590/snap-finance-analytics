## Task 5 - Come up with something interesting with the data to share with us. Keep in mind this is randomly generated sample data so trends may or may not be present, but don’t let that hold you back.

### So what was something interesting I that I found?

![Conversion Rate by Campaign](State_vs_Used_Amount.png)


While exploring the dataset, I came across an unexpected trend worth sharing.

We typically expect high-population states like **California**, **Texas**, or **New York** to top the charts in terms of **total dollars used** — but the data told a different story.

### 🌟 States That Outperformed Expectations
States like:
- **South Dakota**
- **North Dakota**
- **Delaware**

…showed **exceptionally high usage volume**, despite having **comparatively small populations**.

Meanwhile:
- **California** and **Texas** — usually at the top of everything — ranked surprisingly low in usage amount.

---

### 🧐 So What Could This Mean?
- These states might have **higher customer engagement** or more adoption at the merchant level.
- Or maybe Snap's financing just resonates more strongly with customers in these regions.
- Could also hint at untapped opportunity — **other smaller states might be just as profitable** if approached correctly.

### 📌 Final Thought
This isn’t just a fun anomaly. It could be a **lead** for deeper segmentation analysis and strategic marketing focus.  
Sometimes the best markets aren’t the biggest — they’re just the most engaged.
### 🌎 Insights

#### 1. **Overperformance by Low-Population States**
- **South Dakota, North Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island** exhibit unexpectedly high usage levels.
- These states are **not densely populated**, yet they top the list in terms of `used_amount`.
- Possible factors:
  - Limited access to traditional financing.
  - Strong merchant partnerships.
  - Higher financial need per capita.

#### 2. **Underperformance in High-Population States**
- **California** and **Texas**, despite being the most populous states in the U.S., display **relatively modest usage**.
- Possible reasons:
  - Higher competition from alternative lenders and credit options.
  - Stronger credit profiles.
  - Less alignment with Snap Finance's core customer profile.

#### 3. **Balanced States**
- **Michigan, Florida, and Arizona** show high usage in line with mid-to-high population levels.
- These could represent **Snap’s most balanced markets**, with both demand and reach optimized.

### 🧠 Key Takeaway for Stakeholders
> **Snap Finance usage is not directly tied to population density. Instead, usage is significantly higher in states with limited traditional financing or underserved communities. This insight reveals new opportunities to expand strategically into regions with higher potential per capita engagement.**

### 📌 Recommendation
- Focus marketing and merchant acquisition strategies in **low-population, high-usage** states.
- Reassess growth plans in **high-population, low-usage** states to explore barriers or unmet market needs.
